## Jiongxiao Wang

### About
I'm a PhD student at School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence, Arizona State University, where I’m fortunately advised by Professor Chaowei Xiao. I’m broadly interested in machine learning and generative models, especially security related.

### Previous
I got my bachelor degree at School of Mathematical Sciences, Fudan University in June 2022. I also worked as a research assistant at Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong supervised by Prof. James Cheng and Prof. Bo Han.
